This is the Pytorch implementation of SCARF. More details please check our [Project](https://yfeng95.github.io/scarf/) page.

SCARF extracts a 3D clothed avatar from a monocular video.  
SCARF allows us to synthesize new views of the reconstructed avatar, and to animate the avatar with SMPL-X identity shape and pose control. 
The disentanglement of thebody and clothing further enables us to transfer clothing between subjects for virtual try-on applications. 

The key features:
1. animate the avatar by changing body poses (including hand articulation and facial expressions),  
2. synthesize novel views of the avatar, and  
3. transfer clothing between avatars for virtual try-on applications.  


## Getting Started
Clone the repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yfeng95/SCARF
  cd SCARF
  ```  
### Requirements
```bash
conda create -n scarf python=3.9
conda activate scarf
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
If you have problems when installing [pytorch3d](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md), please follow their instructions.  
### Download data 
```
bash fetch_data.sh
```

## Visualization
* check training frames: 
```bash
python main_demo.py --vis_type capture --frame_id 0 
```
* **novel view** synthesis of given frame id: 
```bash
python main_demo.py --vis_type novel_view --frame_id 0 
```
* extract **mesh** and visualize 
```bash
python main_demo.py --vis_type extract_mesh --frame_id 0
```
You can go to our [project](https://yfeng95.github.io/scarf/) page and play with the extracted meshes.

* **animation**  
```bash 
python main_demo.py --vis_type animate
```

* **clothing transfer**
```bash 
# apply clothing from other model 
python main_demo.py --vis_type novel_view --clothing_model_path exps/snapshot/male-3-casual
# transfer clothing to new body
python main_demo.py --vis_type novel_view --body_model_path exps/snapshot/male-3-casual
```

More data and trained models can be found [here](https://nextcloud.tuebingen.mpg.de/index.php/s/3SEwJmZcfY5LnnN), you can download and put them into `./exps`.

## Training 
* training with SCARF video example
```bash
bash train.sh
```
* training with other videos  
check [here](./process_data/README.md) to **prepare data with your own videos**, then change the data_cfg accordingly. 

## TODO
- [ ] add more processed data and trained models
- [ ] code for refining the pose of trained models
- [ ] with instant ngp
